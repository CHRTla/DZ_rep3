# [Ozzy Osbourne - Hellraiser] - Lyrics

---

**[Verse 1]**

I'm living on an endless road

Around the world for rock and roll

Sometimes it feels so tough

But I still ain't had enough

I keep saying that it's getting too much

But I know I'm a liar

---

**[Pre-Chorus 1]**

Feeling all right in the noise and the light

But that's what lights my fire

---

**[Chorus]**

Hellraiser, in the thunder and heat

Hellraiser, rock you back in your seat

Hellraiser, and I'll make it come true

Hellraiser, I'll put a spell on you
